    <p>
      Hey guys, this is my new blog. Thanks to the amazing power of <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, I present this simple interface,
      because simple things are... simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      There still needs to be some work on this, maybe some marquee or blink elements to spice it up? What about a pink and yellow flashing background? Anyway, I can't think of anything, so I'll see you later. Hopefully.
