    <h2>Bryce's Blog</h2>
    <p>This is a simple blog I created that is supposed to be a more informal edition of the CatsUnited News, which currently is non-existant. Whilst CN is professional, I talk about things the way I really want to, no-one else is writing either. Plus, I can't use social media... YET!! <img src="http://i.imgur.com/maETHDE.png"></img></p>
