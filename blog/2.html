      I don't usually make a blog post a day from the last one, since I'll usually be making ones at 1-3 week intervals usually. However, I find <a href="http://google.com/%%30%30">this</a> rather interesting.

      Hey what? Your browser crashed? Well, here's why your browser crashed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Google Chrome/Chromium/Opera render links (<pre><a> tag</pre>) in a strange way. Because of this, you can append %%30%30 to any link and then when you hover over, your browser goes to a Aww Snap! screen.
    You don't need to click on it. <b>You only need to hover over it.</b> I first saw about it in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/152740/">a Scratch forum topic (my programming birthplace).</a> I hovered over it, and sure enough, Chrome crashed.
    If you really want to, click <a href="https://github.com/szhu/3030/tree/master">here</a> for a cool maze.
